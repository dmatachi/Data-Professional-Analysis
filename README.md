I analyzed a set of data professionals to figure out which data career is in high demand in the world today.
After transforming the data using Power Query, I used Power BI to visualize the data. From the visualization, It shows that Data Scientists are in high demand, especially in the United States of America.

I concluded that there is a need for employees to embrace a career in data, especially in Data Science.
